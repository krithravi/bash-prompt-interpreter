prompt interpreter:
	essentially an interpreter for ps0, ps1, ps2 and ps4 in bash
	https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html#Controlling-the-Prompt
	as the user types, whatever they type gets interpreted into
	bash, or returns error. that is:
		if the thing is interpretable, interpret it
		else, show "can't interpret this sorry"
	I want to be able to support colors
	if spot is given, then the variable takes the value of that
		otherwise, one will be provided to you
	sooo

	a few things:
	we'll want to *interpret* (method) on keydown for the main entry field
		this implies reading everything, and outputting results :)
	we'll have to deal with \ (escape char)
		essentially, if the char afterwards is "important*, deal with it
	we'll have to deal with $ too, for env vars
		keep reading until char

	plan:
	work with input and output, and keydown
	https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeydown.asp
	entry fields working from multiple
	then logic/output
